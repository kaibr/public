# Seminar Advice

## Be aware of your audience

A frequent mistake with the talk and the report is that they are addressed at me. That's not the idea. They should be addressed at your fellow students. It helps a lot to have in mind a concrete person for which you're writing the report or for who you're giving the talk. Think of a representative fellow student, let's say, Alice. So, whenever you wonder, "Hm, should I explain frobnifiers? Or do people already know about frobnifiers?" Just think of Alice. Does she know about frobnifiers? If yes, you don't need to explain them. Otherwise you do.

## Slow down

Many seminar talks go much too fast. If you're presenting an algorithm or a cryptographic scheme that took you an afternoon to understand, and you want us to understand it in 25 minutes, that is quite a challenge already. If you squeeze the presentation of the scheme into 5 minutes, then you attempt the impossible. We won't be able to follow you. You'll make us feel stupid. Please don't.

## Understand 

We don't need you to tell us what is written in the material -- we can read perfectly fine, thank you very much! We are interested in your understanding of the material. Say there is an algorithm in the material that you want to present. It probably took you some time to understand it. During that time you first had some wrong ideas about it, tried a couple of examples, corrected your wrong ideas, made some little sketches to visualize the working of the algorithm, and then you finally understood it. We need to see all of that: the wrong ideas, why they are wrong, the examples and the visualizations. That's your contribution.  Not copy-pasting the algorithm.  

## Problem before solution

I have seen quite a number of detailled explanations of algorithms, with extensive and detailled visualizations of the state changes during the iterations etc. -- and during all of that I had no idea what the algorithm is for. Which means the talk was totally lost on me, because I just had no way of being interested. 

Make sure we understand the motivation. Otherwise we won't follow. You can achieve this in a number of ways: spending enough time on motivation, mentioning the motivation several times during the talk, or even simply asking the audience questions to make sure they understood the motivation.

This means that often it is better to present the problem before the solution, rather than the other way around. For example, if you first define Merkle Trees and only then explain why they are useful, many people will not follow your definition.

## Carefully select the material 

You have worked hard to understand a lot of material. Now you'd like to show off the hard work. Resist the temptation. Carefully select the material to present and keep in mind how much time it took you to understand it. I went to many talks and from the majority of them I learned nothing. Focus on one little thing, just one thing that you want everybody to take away from your talk. If you succeed, you've achieved a lot.


## Anticipate questions

If you're presenting, say, a piece of code that acquires and releases a lock in a complicated manner that looks like it could be achieved simply with a 'synchronized' keyword in the right place -- then you should not present it like that. You should ask yourself why the code does it in this complicated manner. Maybe there's a good answer: then that answer should be part of the talk. Maybe there isn't: then the code should be simplified.

## Be honest

If people ask you a question and you don't know the answer, the worst possible behaviour is to guess an answer. That's dishonest. Admit that you don't know and let's look for answer together. Try not to think of this presentation as an exam. Your goal is to understand and to pass on this understanding. Your goal is not to prove that you understand. So never pretend to understand more than you actually do. 

## Understand questions before answering them

In the heat of the moment it's easy to misunderstand a question. Especially if that question is unclear or if you can't answer it. It's easy to reinterpret this question as a different question that you *can* answer. Don't. Before even trying to answer a question, make sure that your understanding of it matches the understanding of the person asking it.

## Be aware of the current knowledge of your audience

Whenever you're presenting B, and an understanding of A is required to understand B, then make sure you first present A. For example, if you're presenting how a byzantine failure can occur in a clock synchronization algorithm, you better make sure we first understand how the algorithm is supposed to work without a failure, before explaining how the failure can occur.

## Separate your own thoughts from other people's thoughts

You're talking about a programming language. A book says the language is well-suited to implement compilers. If you now tell us that the language is well-suited to implement compilers, then that is inacceptable. Don't. What would be acceptable is if you told us that *the book says that* the language is well-suited for writing compilers. What would of course be even better is if you implemented a little compiler in that language, formed your own understanding of whether the language is suited or not and then told us what you learned.
